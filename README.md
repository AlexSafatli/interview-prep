# scraps
Unorganized code and interview practice.

## Purpose

To put code I have not particularly had a reason to place in a project but 
still want to have around to showcase to employers and others, and for myself 
to grab and use later.

## Language Coverage

There are samples of code written in Python (both 2 and 3), C++, Java, Perl, 
and Go. While I love writing code in C, it does not tend to be my language of 
choice for interview preparation.

## Organization
 
The folder structure of this repository is such that all top-level directories 
are named and organized based on what particular website, event, or scenario 
led to the creation of the code within. In all particular folders, further 
organization is typically done based on programming language, and further in by 
other techniques outlined in respective `README` files.

  - **CareerCup** (`./CareerCup`) has interview question answers for that website.
  - **Classical** (`./Classical`) has code that do not belong in any other particular directory but instead deal with classical problems or data structures.
  - **CTCI** (`./CTCI`) is code written while reading the *Cracking the Coding Interview* book.
  - **DPC** (`./DPC`) is code written for the [Dalhousie Programming Competition](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~dpc/).
  - **FEPSQ** (`./FEPSQ`) has code written in response to a blog article found online.
  - **HackerRank** (`./HackerRank`) code is for that website's challenges.
  - **InterviewCake** (`./InterviewCake`) code is for that website's challenges.
  - **NLP** (`./NLP`) contains code from a *Advanced Topics in Natural Language Processing* course taken in university.
  - **TopCoder** (`./TopCoder`) contains code in response to challenges found on that website.

## Comment Notation

Certain shorthand is used in some comments. For example, `@REP` indicates that 
a particular problem or structure in code has been found in another resource or 
problem set. This is followed by where and how it can be found in that 
resource.
